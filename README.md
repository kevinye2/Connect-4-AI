# Connect-4-AI

## Motiation of Connect 4 AI
This game has been extensively studied for game theory and AI, and the earliest tree-based AI engines were developed on these relatively simple games. Although not as cutting edge and recent as reinfocement learning, neural nets, and Q-learning, we want to explore these seeminly simple, yet fundamental techineques, in Connect 4. This will help us learn about and examine search/time complexity, reduction in bottlenecks/repeated calls, various heuristics for making an (or estimated) optimal choice, and optimization in the tree search.

## Goals
Our goal in this project is to explore the different types of search methods (with minimax, alpha-beta pruning, cacheing) to play Connect 4. We want to analyze our results of the game playing itself with different move exploration heuristics as well as different levels of search depth. Some benchmarks will be to measure the time taken to compute up to a certain depth, as well as the number of nodes explored.
